### Personal Info
- **Emergency Contact** -- name and phone number
- **Photo** -- profile photo (optional)
- **Address** -- their home address (for route planning)

### Work Info

  - Move-Out
  - Pet Homes
  - Post-Construction
  - Commercial

## Assigning Jobs to Cleaners

### Method 1: During Job Creation
When creating a new job, use the **Assign To** dropdown to select a cleaner.

### Method 2: From the Job Detail
1. Open an existing job.
2. Click the assignment dropdown.
3. Select a cleaner.
4. Save.

### Best Practices
- Check the cleaner's **availability** before assigning.
- Match the job's **service type** to the cleaner's **specialties**.
- Consider the job **location** vs. the cleaner's **service areas**.
- Look at the **calendar** to avoid scheduling conflicts.

## Monitoring Cleaner Activity

### Job Completion Tracking
For each job assigned to a cleaner, you can see:
- **On My Way** timestamp -- when they started heading to the job
- **Clock In** time -- when they arrived and started working
- **Clock Out** time -- when they finished
- **Completion** timestamp -- when they marked the job done
- **Cleaning Observations** -- their notes about the job

### Two-Stage Approval
When a cleaner marks a job as **Cleaner Completed**:
1. You receive a notification.
2. Review the job details, checklist, and observations.
3. Click **Approve** to change status to **Completed**.
4. Payment can then be processed.

This gives you quality control before the customer is charged.

## Tracking Cleaner Performance

Each cleaner has a Performance Dashboard showing:

### Metrics
- **Total Jobs Completed** -- lifetime count
- **Hours Worked** -- total hours from clock-in to clock-out
- **Average Customer Rating** -- based on customer feedback (1-5 stars)
- **Earnings** -- calculated from hours worked x hourly rate

### Customer Feedback
After each job, customers can leave:
- Star rating (1-5)
- Written feedback
- Tips

You and the cleaner can view all feedback in their performance section.

## Cleaner Pay Management

### Recording Pay

1. Go to the team member's profile.
2. Navigate to the **Pay** section.
3. Add a new pay log:

| Pay Type | Fields |
|----------|--------|
| **Paycheck** | Amount, hours worked, hourly rate, pay period start/end |
| **Supplies Reimbursement** | Amount, description, receipt URL |
| **Gas Reimbursement** | Amount, description |

### Paycheck Calculation
For paychecks, the system uses:
- **Hours Worked** -- from clock-in/clock-out records
- **Hourly Rate** -- set in the cleaner's profile
- **Pay Period** -- start and end dates

### Tracking Expenses
In **Settings > Operations**, set:
- **Gas Reimbursement Rate** -- per mile or per job
- **Cleaning Supplies Cost** -- monthly budget
- These feed into your financial dashboard

## Activating and Deactivating Team Members

### Deactivating
If a cleaner leaves or you need to temporarily suspend access:
1. Go to **Team** and find the member.
2. Toggle **Active** off.
3. The member can no longer log in.
4. Their historical data (completed jobs, pay logs) is preserved.

### Reactivating
Toggle **Active** back on. The member can log in again immediately.
