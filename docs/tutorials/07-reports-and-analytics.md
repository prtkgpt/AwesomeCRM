## Using Reports Effectively

### Weekly Review
Run a quick weekly report every Monday:
1. Go to Reports, select **Last Week**.
2. Check: revenue, jobs completed, outstanding payments.
3. Look for cancellations or no-shows to follow up on.
4. Review any negative customer feedback.

### Monthly Review
At the start of each month:
1. Review last month's revenue vs. previous month.
2. Check customer retention -- how many clients rebooked?
3. Review cleaner performance -- anyone falling behind?
4. Check outstanding invoices and follow up.
5. Review campaign results -- did marketing drive new bookings?

### Quarterly Review
Every quarter:
1. Analyze revenue trends -- growing, flat, or declining?
2. Review profit margins by service type -- which services are most profitable?
3. Assess team capacity -- do you need more cleaners?
4. Evaluate operational expenses -- any areas to cut costs?
5. Review referral program performance -- is it worth the investment?

## Exporting Data

- Use the **Backup** feature in Settings to export all company data.
- Backups include: clients, bookings, invoices, team members, and transaction history.
- Data is exported in a structured format that can be processed further.

## Tips

1. **Check reports regularly** -- weekly reviews catch problems early.
2. **Track revenue by service type** -- you may find deep cleans are more profitable and worth promoting.
3. **Monitor cancellation rates** -- high cancellations may signal pricing or scheduling issues.
4. **Use customer ratings** -- consistently low ratings for a cleaner indicate training needs.
5. **Compare periods** -- always compare month-over-month or year-over-year to spot trends.
