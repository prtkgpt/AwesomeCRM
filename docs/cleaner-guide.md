## Working a Job

### Before You Leave

1. Review the job details on your dashboard: address, notes, gate code, parking info.
2. Check the **client preferences** section for any special instructions (products to avoid, cleaning sequence, pet handling).

### On My Way

When you are heading to the job:
1. Open the job on your dashboard.
2. Tap **On My Way**.
3. This sends an automatic notification to the office and (optionally) to the customer, letting them know you are en route.

### Clocking In

When you arrive and start cleaning:
1. Tap **Clock In** on the job.
2. This records your start time for payroll and performance tracking.

### Job Checklist

Each job may have a **checklist** depending on the service type. The checklist breaks down tasks by room:

**Standard Clean checklist example:**
- Kitchen: wipe counters, clean sink, mop floor, etc.
- Bathrooms: scrub toilet, clean mirror, wipe surfaces, etc.
- Bedrooms: make beds, dust surfaces, vacuum, etc.
- Living areas: dust furniture, vacuum/mop, tidy up

**Deep Clean** and **Move-Out** checklists include additional tasks like inside appliances, baseboards, and window tracks.

Mark each task as you complete it. The checklist tracks your progress percentage.

### Clocking Out

When you finish the job:
1. Tap **Clock Out**.
2. This records your end time.

### Completing the Job

After clocking out:
1. Tap **Complete Job**.
2. Optionally add **cleaning observations** -- notes about the condition of the home, anything the customer should know, or issues you encountered.
3. The job status changes to **Cleaner Completed**.
4. Your admin will review and approve the job.

> You do not process payments. That is handled by the office after they approve the job.

## Tips for Success

1. **Check your dashboard every morning** -- review today's jobs, notes, and any special instructions before heading out.
2. **Use the checklist** -- it ensures consistency and helps you avoid missing tasks.
3. **Clock in and out accurately** -- this affects your pay and helps the office track job duration.
4. **Read client preferences** -- customers appreciate when you remember their preferences (no bleach, start with kitchen, keep dog in yard, etc.).
5. **Add cleaning observations** -- note anything the admin or next cleaner should know (e.g., "stain on carpet in bedroom, couldn't remove" or "front door lock is stiff").
6. **Respond to ratings** -- if you receive feedback, use it constructively. High ratings lead to more job assignments.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't see any jobs
- Make sure you are logged in with the correct email.
- Jobs only appear if your admin has **assigned** them to you. If you don't see anything, check with your admin.

### My invitation link expired
- Ask your admin to send a new invitation. Links expire after 7 days.

### I can't log in
- Double-check your email and password.
- Use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page to reset your password.
- If your account has been **deactivated** by an admin, you will not be able to log in. Contact your admin.

### I completed a job but it still shows as "Scheduled"
- Make sure you tapped **Complete Job** (not just Clock Out). Clock Out records your time; Complete Job changes the status.
